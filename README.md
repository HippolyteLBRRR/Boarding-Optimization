# Boarding-Optimization

GitHub of our project Boarding optimization of a Boeing 777.

Students : Hippolyte LABARRIERE, Joao HEMPTINNE, Hugo FERRER

First_Model contains our first research : the algorithm which calculates the boarding time, some existing boarding methods implemented and some tests.

Model is the file used at the end of project with the same algorithm but with accurate parameters.

Rush finds the part of the boarding used to calculate the boarding time : the "rush" part of the boarding.

Excel transforms one Excel file with information on 78 flights into an Excel with 78 sheets.

main is the file we used to calculate the boarding time of a given boarding : it contains the function which transforms Excel data into Python data

Coeffs contains an optimization algorithm which allowed us to find good time parameters.
